# 21DIASDECÃ“DIGO

## The theory of the 21 days says:

To acquire new habits, you have to do something in practice for 21 uninterrupted days.

For example: practice some physical exercise at home for 21 days, without skipping a step.

The idea is to do something over and over again until it becomes automatic.
